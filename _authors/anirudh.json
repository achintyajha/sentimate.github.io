  "content": "Hi, I am an high school student. I joined and started writing articles cause I believe that in todays world, one word document with words can change the world. I am here trying to make that change. \"How vain it is to sit down to write when you have not stood up to live.\" \"I can shake off everything as I write; my sorrows disappear, my courage is reborn.\" \"A writer is someone for whom writing is more difficult than it is for other people. A book, a article, a few words can motivate a person to be greatest of all or prevent them to fall down. I am working to be this writer."
