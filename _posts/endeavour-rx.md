ADHD directly translates to Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and it is one of the most common
mental disorders affecting children. According to the American Psychiatric Association, an estimated 8.4
2.5 percent have ADHD. The CDC estimates that the number of children ever diagnosed with ADHD is
6.1 million. This number includes 388,000 children ages two to five years, 2.4 million children aged six
to eleven years, and 3.3 million children aged twelve to seventeen years.

ADHD often causes various symptoms and disorders to prevail. The CDC writes that many children are
also affected by depression, Tourette syndrome, and an autism spectrum disorder. About five in ten
children with ADHD have a behavior or conduct problem, while another three in ten children have
anxiety. Other common symptoms occur in impulsive, hyperactive, and inattentive behavior.

Although many children are diagnosed with ADHD and suffer from the many symptoms and disorders
that occur, scientists have been unable to identify the specific causes of ADHD. The American
Psychiatric Association writes, “There is evidence that genetics contribute to ADHD. For example, three
out of four children with ADHD have a relative with the disorder. Other factors that may contribute to the
development of ADHD include being born prematurely, brain injury, and the mother smoking, using
alcohol, or having extreme stress during pregnancy.”

The current, and most common treatment, of ADHD is in the form of medication. The medication comes
in the form of either stimulants or non-stimulants. An example of stimulant medication is
amphetamines. These include amphetamine, dextroamphetamine, and lisdexamfetamine; it acts as either
an immediate-release drug or an extended-release drug. An example of a non-stimulant medication is
Clonidine ER (Kapvay), which is used to reduce hyperactivity, impulsiveness, and distractibility in
people with ADHD. There are many other types of medicine that can be used, however, many of these
drugs come with side effects. The most common side effects are loss of appetite and trouble sleeping, as
well as, jitteriness, irritability, moodiness, headaches, stomachaches, fast heart rate, and high blood
pressure.

EndeavorRx seeks to change the current treatment of ADHD, as it has become the first FDA-approved
prescription video game. Designed for kids ages eight to twelves with ADHD, EndeavorRx challenges its
patients to focus on multiple tasks simultaneously within the game environment. EndeavorRx is one of
the many digital therapeutics on the rise. EndeavorRx uses technology to engage its patients and improve
their attention skills through gameplay. The game grows more challenging as the child’s attention
improves. In the game, a child guides a character along a course, while they avoid obstacles along the
way. The game promotes both visual and auditory stimulation, which acts as a source of distraction while
playing. Endeavor RX requires the child to focus on several things at the same time and develops to
challenge their weaknesses while supporting their strengths.

The app is aimed to help children with ADHD, by providing a distracting setting that builds on their
multitasking abilities. The recommended playing time is about twenty-five minutes per day, five days a
week, for four weeks, however, this timeline can be extended or shortened, depending on the individual’s needs.
Used with traditional ADHD medicine, the overall goal of EndeavorRx is to provide a fun and
relaxing environment that eliminates the common symptoms of ADHD.

EndeavorRx has participated in five clinical studies on over six hundred children. A clinical trial
published in 2020 compared EndeavorRx to other focus-based video games. After a four-week period, it
was reported that EndeavorRx had improved attention more than traditional video games. A follow-up
study was published in 2021 to determine whether EndeavorRx was effective when used over longer
periods of time. After a twelve-week period, the study was able to confirm that EndeavorRx is effective
over time and that it can be used with or without medication, and still give positive results.

In a randomized, controlled clinical trial conducted by the developers of EndeavorRx, they reported the
game to improve objective attention in children with ADHD. According to the study, “Up to a third of
kids had a clinically meaningful change in ADHD symptoms after one month of treatment, a number that
rose to 45% after a second month. Additionally, 48% of parents indicated that EndeavorRx improved
their child’s ADHD-related day-to-day impairment, and 56% said it helped improve their attention.”

Overall, ADHD is a common diagnosis among kids, and it contributes to many unwanted symptoms and
disorders such as insomnia, hyperactivity, and Tourette syndrome. For children, ages eight to twelve, a
new option uses technology to aid ADHD, in conjunction with traditional medications. EndeavorRx is a
game that challenges patients to work on several tasks simultaneously while functioning under distracting
environments. The game uses fun characters and unique tasks to keep the player engaged while
addressing the common symptoms of ADHD. A combination of sensory stimuli and simultaneous motor
challenges are used to activate areas of the brain that play a key role in attention function; the game is
programmed to adapt to meet the needs of each patient. Many studies have proven that EndeavorRx
works to improve the symptoms of ADHD, with or without the assistance of traditional medications. It is
also reported to be increasingly effective given the increased duration of playtime.

The development of EndeavorRx is just one of the many new digital treatment options for various mental
health conditions. As seen with EndeavorRx, AI can greatly benefit people with various types of mental
health issues; they can offer a modern solution, rather than medications. AI creeping into mental health
services allows more people to involve themselves with treatment, and for medications to become less
common. These AI services provide minimal side effects and generally cost less than medicine and
therapy. AI also allows mental health services to be offered with more convenience, as these programs
can adapt to an individual’s changes, development, and commitments.

After the COVID-19 pandemic, mental health disorders have increased to affect one-fifths of people in
the United States alone. With this rise in mental health disorders, as well as the limited health care
services, AI will act as the newest solution. Over the last few years, AI has expanded to revolutionize
healthcare. Currently, AI can be used to analyze patient data and assess the probability of developing
mental health conditions, classify disorders, and suggest optimum treatment plans. It can also Conduct
self-assessment and therapy sessions, and make psychological interventions by automatically giving
appropriate information to the patient. By looking at the current developments in AI, it is inevitable that
they will revamp all types of health care services.
